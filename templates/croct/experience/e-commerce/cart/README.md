# Introduction

This template defines a personalized experience for e-commerce visitors based on their [shopping cart](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/data-types/shopping?utm_medium=cli&utm_source=template&utm_campaign=00000000.CO.DE.e_commerce&utm_content=cart) total.

It can be used to encourage higher-order values by highlighting incentives such as free shipping after certain thresholds.

## What's included

This experience includes:

- **Components:** banner image, CTA, announcement bar, and carousel section
- **Slots:** announcement bar and carousel section
- **Audience:** `cart's total is less than 150`

Custom audiences can be defined using the [Contextual Query Language (CQL)](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/introduction?utm_medium=cli&utm_source=template&utm_campaign=00000000.CO.DE.e_commerce&utm_content=cart), a readable, natural-language-inspired syntax designed for flexibility and ease of use. It supports, for instance, other comparisons like [greater than](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/expressions/tests/comparison#greater-than) or [between](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/expressions/tests/comparison#between).

> ðŸ’¬ Event tracking

> Personalization with the `cart` variable requires tracking [e-commerce events](https://docs.croct.com/reference/event/overview?utm_medium=cli&utm_source=template&utm_campaign=00000000.CO.DE.e_commerce&utm_content=cart#e-commerce-events) in advance.
