# Introduction

This template defines a personalized experience for e-commerce visitors coming from Instagram paid campaigns.

It leverages [UTM parameters](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/data-types/marketing) from ad URLs to align onsite content with the visitorâ€™s interests, creating a seamless and consistent journey from ad to landing page and beyond.

## What's included

This experience includes 4 components, 3 slots (a navbar, a carousel section, and a section with featured products), and the following audience:

```cql
campaign's source is "instagram" and campaign's content matches "shoes"
```

Define custom audiences using the [Contextual Query Language (CQL)](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/introduction), a readable, natural-language-inspired syntax designed for flexibility and ease of use. It allows, for instance, to add two or more campaigns to the same audience using [or](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/expressions/operations/logical#or), [and](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/expressions/operations/logical#and), [starts with](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/expressions/tests/string#starts-with), [ends with](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/expressions/tests/string#ends-with), or [matches](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/expressions/tests/string#matches).
