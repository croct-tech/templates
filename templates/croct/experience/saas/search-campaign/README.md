It leverages [UTM parameters](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/data-types/marketing/campaign) from ad URLs to align onsite
content with the visitorâ€™s search intent, creating a seamless and consistent journey from ad to landing page and beyond.

## What's included

This experience includes 4 components, 3 slots (a home hero, a home featured topics, and a testimonials sections), and
the following audience:

```cql
campaign's source is "google" and campaign's term matches "student"
```

Define custom audiences using the [Contextual Query Language (CQL)](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/introduction),
a readable, natural-language-inspired syntax designed for flexibility and ease of use. It allows, for instance, to add
two or more campaigns to the same audience
using [or](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/expressions/operations/logical/or), [and](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/expressions/operations/logical/and), [starts with](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/expressions/tests/string/starts-with), [ends with](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/expressions/tests/string/ends-with),
or [matches](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/expressions/tests/string/matches).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Personalization with the `campaign's term` variable requires campaigns' final URLs with the `utm_term` parameter.
