# Introduction

This template defines a personalized experience for SaaS visitors coming from paid search campaigns.

It leverages [UTM parameters](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/data-types/marketing from ad URLs to align onsite content with the visitorâ€™s search intent, creating a seamless and consistent journey from ad to landing page and beyond.

## What's included

This experience includes 4 components, 3 slots (a home hero, a home featured topics, and a testimonials sections), and the following audience:

```cql
campaign's source is "google" and campaign's term matches "student"
```

Define custom audiences using the [Contextual Query Language (CQL)](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/introduction), a readable, natural-language-inspired syntax designed for flexibility and ease of use. It allows, for instance, to add two or more campaigns to the same audience using [or](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/expressions/operations/logical#or), [and](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/expressions/operations/logical#and), [starts with](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/expressions/tests/string#starts-with), [ends with](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/expressions/tests/string#ends-with), or [matches](https://docs.croct.com/reference/cql/expressions/tests/string#matches).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Personalization with the `campaign's term` variable requires campaigns' final URLs with the `utm_term` parameter.
