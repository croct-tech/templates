# Introduction

Announcement bars highlight time-sensitive updates, offers, legal notices, or other key messages in a clear and
accessible way.

Placing them at the top of the screen and using effective color, layout, and typography ensures the message stands out
without interrupting the browsing experience and helps guide visitor attention to essential information or next steps.

Besides showing general messaging, running AB tests with different variations and applying personalization, such as
tailoring promotions based on visitor location or behavior, can help optimize visibility, boost engagement, and drive
higher conversion.
