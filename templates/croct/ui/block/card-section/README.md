# Introduction

A card section organizes content into visually distinct blocks, ideal for showcasing features, services, or articles in
a clean, scannable format.

AB testing different arrangements or messaging within cards and personalizing the card content based on user behavior or
segment, such as showing relevant features to returning visitors, can increase relevance, engagement, and performance.
