# Introduction

A card section organizes content into visually distinct blocks.

This layout presents multiple offerings—such as features, services, or articles—in a clean and scannable format.
The call-to-action in each card encourages further interaction, making this section ideal for guiding visitors
toward deeper exploration or conversion.
