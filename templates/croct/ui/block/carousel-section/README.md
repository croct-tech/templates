# Introduction

A carousel section displays multiple banners in a rotating, swipeable format.

Often used on home pages, landing pages, or product sections to showcase various highlights within limited space,
it helps keep the layout dynamic and maintains visual interest.

Running AB tests on banner order, visuals, or messaging and personalizing the banners based on audience segments,
such as showing different promotions by source, device, or behavior, can increase engagement and conversion.
