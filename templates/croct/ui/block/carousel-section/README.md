# Introduction

A carousel section displays multiple pieces of image banners in a rotating, swipeable format.

Positioned prominently on home pages, landing pages, or product sections, it allows for showcasing a variety
of highlights within limited space. By cycling through content, a carousel section keeps the layout dynamic
while maintaining visual interest and emphasizing multiple focal points.

## Usage
