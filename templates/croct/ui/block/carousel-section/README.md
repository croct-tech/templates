# Introduction

A carousel section displays multiple banners in a rotating, swipeable format. Besides the static,
generic set of banners, it can also display personalized content for different audiences.

Positioned prominently on home pages, landing pages, or product sections, it allows for showcasing a variety
of highlights within limited space. By cycling through content, a carousel section keeps the layout dynamic
while maintaining visual interest and emphasizing multiple focal points.
