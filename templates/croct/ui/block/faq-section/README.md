# Introduction

An FAQ section addresses common questions in a structured format, helping visitors find relevant information without
leaving the page.

Typically placed near sign-up forms, pricing tables, or product details, it clarifies product features, pricing, usage,
or policies at key decision-making moments. It reduces support requests by resolving doubts upfront, building trust,
and improving the overall experience.

Personalizing FAQs based on visitor behavior or segments, such as tailoring questions for first-time vs. returning users
and testing different phrasing or order, can increase clarity, engagement, and conversion.
