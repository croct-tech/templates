# Introduction

An FAQ section addresses common questions to help visitors quickly find relevant information without leaving the page.
Besides the static, generic set of questions, it can also display personalized content for different audiences.

Structured as a list of expandable items or clearly separated entries, it improves clarity around product features,
pricing, usage, or policies. This section reduces support requests, builds trust, and enhances the user experience
by proactively resolving doubts. Strategic placement—often near sign-up forms, pricing tables, or product
details—ensures critical answers are accessible at key decision-making moments.
