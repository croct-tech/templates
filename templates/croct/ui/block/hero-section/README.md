# Introduction

A hero section serves as the primary visual and informational focus at the top of a webpage. Besides the static,
generic content, it can also display personalized content for different audiences.

Often combining a headline, a tagline, a call to action, and an image, it introduces the site's main
value proposition or purpose in a bold and engaging way. With strategic use of layout, imagery, and typography,
the hero section plays a key role in driving engagement and guiding visitors toward desired actions.
