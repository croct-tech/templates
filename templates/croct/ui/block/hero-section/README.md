# Introduction

A hero section serves as the primary visual and informational focus at the top of a webpage.

Often combining a headline, a tagline, a call to action, and an image, it introduces the site's main value proposition
or purpose in a bold and engaging way. Its strategic design draws attention and guides visitors toward key actions.

Personalizing the hero content based on visitor context, such as showing different messages by traffic source,
device type, or past behavior, and running AB tests on layout, copy, or visuals can significantly improve engagement
and conversion.
