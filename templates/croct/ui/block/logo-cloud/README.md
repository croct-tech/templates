# Introduction

A logo cloud is commonly used to showcase partnerships, integrations, clients, or media features, which can be
personalized for different audiences.

Typically arranged in a grid or carousel format, it provides visual proof of credibility and trust. This section
is often placed near testimonials, hero sections, or calls to action to reinforce authority and social validation.
