# Introduction

A logo cloud showcases partnerships, integrations, clients, or media features, providing visual proof of credibility
and trust.

It reinforces authority and social validation when placed near testimonials, hero sections, or calls to action.

Personalizing the logos, such as highlighting companies from the same industry or region as the visitor, and AB testing
different arrangements or groupings can make the content feel more relevant and increase perceived trust.
