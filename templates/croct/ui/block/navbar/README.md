# Introduction

A navbar provides a structured navigation system that helps visitors explore different sections or pages of a website.

Positioned at the top of the screen, it typically includes links to key areas such as the homepage, products, offers,
content, or contact pages. Clear labeling and logical organization within the navbar enhance the overall
user experience and support efficient site navigation.
