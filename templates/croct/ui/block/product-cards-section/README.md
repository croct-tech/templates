# Introduction

A card section organizes products into visually distinct blocks.

Arranged in a grid or carousel, these cards allow for quick browsing and comparison across multiple offerings.
Product cards are commonly used in e-commerce sites, feature pages, and landing pages to highlight key details
and drive engagement or conversions.
