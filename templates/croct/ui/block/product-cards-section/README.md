# Introduction

A card section organizes products into visually distinct blocks, typically arranged in a grid or carousel to enable
quick browsing and comparison.

Common in e-commerce, feature pages, and landing pages, product cards highlight key details to drive engagement
and conversions.

Personalizing the products shown, such as surfacing items based on browsing history or purchase intent, and testing
different layouts, imagery, or calls to action can improve relevance and boost performance.
