# Introduction

A testimonial section showcases feedback from customers or users to build trust and credibility.

Positioned on landing pages, product pages, or near calls to action, it highlights real experiences that validate
the value and quality of a product or service.

Personalizing testimonials, such as showing reviews from similar industries or use cases, and AB testing
different quotes, formats, or placements can strengthen social proof and improve conversion rates.
