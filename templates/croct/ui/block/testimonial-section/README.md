# Introduction

A testimonial section showcases feedback from customers or users to build trust and credibility. Besides the static,
generic set of reviews, it can also display personalized content for different audiences.

Positioned strategically on landing pages, product pages, or near calls to action, it highlights real experiences
that validate the value and quality of a product or service. This section is crucial in influencing decisions
by providing social proof and reinforcing key messaging through relatable, persuasive voices.
