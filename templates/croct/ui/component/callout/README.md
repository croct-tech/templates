# Introduction

A callout highlights key information or actions within a page, using contrasting styles to emphasize limited-time
offers, important updates, feature highlights, or next steps in a user journey. It breaks the flow intentionally
to ensure critical content stands out.

Personalizing callouts, such as showing different messages based on user stage or referral source, and AB testing
variations in copy, placement, or design can improve visibility, relevance, and engagement.

## Usage
