# Introduction

A callout highlights key information or actions within a page to draw extra attention and guide user focus. Besides
the static, generic content, it can also display personalized content for different audiences.

Often styled with contrasting styles, callouts help emphasize limited-time offers, important updates,
feature highlights, or the next steps in a user journey. This component breaks the flow intentionally to ensure
critical content stands out.

## Usage

To add this component to your workspace, run:

```js-pm
