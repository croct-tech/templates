# Introduction

A callout highlights key information or actions within a page to draw extra attention and guide user focus.

Often styled with contrasting styles, callouts help emphasize limited-time offers, important updates,
feature highlights, or the next steps in a user journey. This component breaks the flow intentionally to ensure
critical content stands out.

## Usage

To configure a new callout in your account using this template, run:

```js-pm
croct@latest use croct://ui/component/callout
```
