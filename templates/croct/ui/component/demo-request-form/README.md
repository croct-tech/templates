# Introduction

A demo request form allows potential customers to request a live product or service demonstration.

It typically collects basic information like name, email, company, and preferred demo time and offers clear
instructions, a compelling offer, and easy-to-fill fields to help streamline the scheduling process and move users
closer to conversion.

Personalizing the form, such as pre-filling fields based on known data, adapting messaging by audience segment, and
AB testing different layouts or incentives, can increase form completion rates and accelerate the sales pipeline.
