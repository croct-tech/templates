# Introduction

A demo request form allows potential customers to request a live product or service demonstration. Besides the static,
generic form structure and fields, it can also display a personalized form for different audiences.

Typically including fields for basic information like name, email, company, and preferred demo time, this form
streamlines the process of scheduling personalized product walkthroughs. Clear instructions, a compelling offer,
and easy-to-fill fields encourage users to take the next step, moving them closer to conversion.
