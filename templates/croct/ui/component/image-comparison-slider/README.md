# Introduction

An image comparison slider displays two images side by side with a draggable handle that reveals the difference
between them. Besides the static, generic images, it can also display personalized images for different audiences.

Commonly used to showcase before-and-after states, product improvements, or visual transformations, this interactive
component allows users to explore changes clearly and engagingly. Typically placed in feature sections or case studies,
the slider enhances visual storytelling by emphasizing contrast and impact.
