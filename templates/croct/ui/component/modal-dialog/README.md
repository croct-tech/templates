# Introduction

A modal dialog displays content in a focused overlay above the main page.

Commonly used for forms, confirmations, alerts, or additional information and designed to interrupt the normal flow,
it centers the user's attention on a specific task.

Personalizing the modal content, such as showing tailored offers, messages based on user behavior, or dynamic forms,
and AB testing variations in timing or copy, can increase relevance, reduce friction, and improve conversion rates.
