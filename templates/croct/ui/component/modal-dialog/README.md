# Introduction

A modal dialog displays content in a focused overlay above the main page, often used for actions that require
user attention or input without navigating away.

Common use cases include forms, confirmations, alerts, or additional information. Designed to interrupt the normal flow,
it centers the user's focus on a specific task.

## Usage

To configure a new modal dialog in your account using this template, run:

```js-pm
