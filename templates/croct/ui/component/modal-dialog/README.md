# Introduction

A modal dialog displays content in a focused overlay above the main page, often used for actions that require
user attention or input without navigating away. Besides the static,  generic content, it can also display personalized
content for different audiences.

Common use cases include forms, confirmations, alerts, or additional information. Designed to interrupt the normal flow,
it centers the user's focus on a specific task.
