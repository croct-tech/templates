# Introduction

A navbar provides a structured navigation system that helps visitors explore different sections or pages of a website.

Positioned at the top of the screen, it typically includes links to key areas such as the homepage, products, offers,
content, or contact pages. Clear labeling and logical organization enhance the overall user experience and support
efficient site navigation.

Personalizing the navbar, such as highlighting relevant links based on user behavior or segment, and AB testing
variations in structure, labels, or order can improve engagement and guide users more effectively toward key actions.
