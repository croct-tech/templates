# Introduction

A navbar provides a structured navigation system that helps visitors explore different sections or pages of a website.
Besides the static, generic structure, it can also display personalized content for different audiences.

Positioned at the top of the screen, it typically includes links to key areas such as the homepage, products, offers,
content, or contact pages. Clear labeling and logical organization within the navbar enhance the overall
user experience and support efficient site navigation.
