# Introduction

A newsletter form collects email subscriptions from visitors, allowing them to receive updates, promotions, or news
directly in their inbox.

Typically placed in prominent sections like the footer, sidebar, or pop-up, it is designed to be simple, often asking
for just an email address and offering a clear call to action. A well-designed form helps build a subscriber base,
strengthen customer relationships, and maintain audience engagement.

Personalizing the form, such as adjusting messaging based on visitor interests or behavior, and AB testing variations
in copy, placement, or incentives can improve subscription rates and audience retention.
