# Introduction

A newsletter form collects email subscriptions from visitors, allowing them to receive updates, promotions, or news
directly in their inbox. Besides the static,  generic form structure and fields, it can also display personalized form
for different audiences.

Typically placed in prominent sections like the footer, sidebar, or pop-up, the form is simple, usually asking for just
an email address and offering a clear call to action. A well-designed newsletter form helps build a subscriber base,
strengthen customer relationships, and keep the audience informed.
