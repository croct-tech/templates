# Introduction

A newsletter form collects email subscriptions from visitors, allowing them to receive updates, promotions, or news
directly in their inbox.

Typically placed in prominent sections like the footer, sidebar, or pop-up, the form is simple, usually asking for just
an email address and offering a clear call to action. A well-designed newsletter form helps build a subscriber base,
strengthen customer relationships, and keep the audience informed.
