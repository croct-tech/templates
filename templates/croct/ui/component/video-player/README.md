# Introduction

A video player embeds and plays multimedia content directly within a webpage, enabling users to watch videos without
leaving the site. Besides the static, generic video, it can also display personalized video for different audiences.

Commonly used for product demos, tutorials, testimonials, or promotional content, it typically includes controls for
play, pause, volume, fullscreen, and captions. Positioned in hero sections, feature highlights, or educational
content blocks, the video player adds a dynamic, engaging element to the page.
