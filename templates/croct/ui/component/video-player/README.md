# Introduction

A video player embeds and plays multimedia content directly within a webpage, enabling users to watch videos without
leaving the site.

Commonly used for product demos, tutorials, testimonials, or promotional content, it typically appears in hero sections,
feature highlights, or educational content blocks, adding a dynamic and engaging element to the page, and includes
controls for play, pause, volume, fullscreen, and captions.

Personalizing video content, such as showing different versions based on visitor behavior, segment, or interests, and
AB testing variations in placement, thumbnail, or autoplay settings can increase engagement and conversion.
